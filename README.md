# 🚢🧊 SAR Image Classification: Icebergs vs. Vessels  
**URSA Space Systems – Collaborative Research Project**

## Project Overview

This repository supports a collaborative research initiative with URSA Space Systems focused on classifying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery of maritime scenes. Our primary objective is to distinguish between **icebergs** and **vessels** using a combination of image-based and vectorized modeling approaches.

The project involves:
- Scraping and preprocessing SAR image data
- Testing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other image-based classifiers
- Vectorizing image features and training models on structured representations
- Comparing performance across modeling strategies to identify optimal classification pipelines

## Goals

- Evaluate the effectiveness of CNNs and image processing models on raw SAR imagery
- Engineer vectorized representations of SAR images for traditional ML models
- Benchmark classification accuracy, precision, and robustness across approaches
- Provide insights into scalable workflows for maritime object detection

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Tools**: GitHub Projects, Jupyter Notebooks, VSCode  
- **Data Sources**: SAR imagery scraped from URSA datasets and public maritime archives
